    <strong><em>Gilius Thunderhead</em></strong> is one of the main characters in the <strong><em>Golden Axe</em></strong> franchise, a white haired, bearded dwarf who is one of the original warriors to rise up against Death Adder. He wears a green
    tunic, brown leather boots and a
    green topped Norse-style horned helmet. His weapon of choice is his silver coloured broad axe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gilius Thunderhead and his young brother and only relative (in the games), "GarÄ«", were among the soldiers from the Firewood Kingdom fighting against Death Adder's army. </p>

  <p>
    When Death Adder attacked, Gilius was knocked out during the battle.
    Gilius was the only soldier that survived the attack. When he recovered consciousness, his dead brother was lying on Gilius, apparently protecting him from the massacre.
  </p>

  <p>
    Six years later, Gilius learns that Death Adder invaded the Southwood Kingdom and captured the King and Princess. Seeking revenge and justice, Gilius Thunderhead took up arms against Death Adder and his dark forces. Along with Tyris Flare and Ax
    Battler, Gilius pushed back the forces of Death Adder, retrieved the Golden Axe, and renewed peace across the land.

  <h2>Ax Battler List</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ax Battler is a barbarian hero. He uses a claymore while wearing a loincloth and blue boots as well as iron bracers and a gorget. He calls upon volcanic magic, deploying lava and powerful eruptive blasts. Ax's mother is murdered by Death
      Adder's forces, providing his motive in the original Golden Axe. Ax was given a solo game for the Sega Game Gear title Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe, in which he is charged with saving another kingdom. Battler is the most balanced
      character, having a better striking range and less spell-power than Tyris, and more powerful magic but not the extended physical reach of Gilius.Tyris Flare is an amazon who wields a cinquedea-type sword while wearing a chainmail bikini,
      bracers and red boots. Both her parents are murdered by Death Adder's forces, leading her to seek revenge in the first Golden Axe game. Her magic attacks are all fire-based, including the summoning of a giant, flame-spewing dragon. Tyris has
      the shortest range of the heroes, but possesses the most powerful spells. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Gilius Thunderhead is a bearded dwarf who (at least in the arcade version) actually commands the Golden Axe. He wears a green tunic, leather boots and a horned helmet. He seeks revenge in Golden Axe after his brother is murdered by Death
      Adder's forces, returning again to defeat Dark Guld in Golden Axe II. In Golden Axe III, Gilius is the only character from the previous games to appear, though he is not playable, he starts each of the characters off on their quest at the
      game's beginning. When Death Adder returns from the dead in Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder, Gilius rides on the back of playable character Goah throughout the game, and sacrifices his life at game's end to vanquish Death Adder once and
      for all. Gilius is granted the least powerful spells in the game, but has the best striking range in battle. Gillius is a recurring playable character in the Sega SuperStars series.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Death Adder is a tyrannical giant who wears a full iron helmet, pointed spaulders, and wields an enormous double axe. In addition to his brutal strength and speed while attacking, he can also cast magical spells. With his army, he enslaves
      the kingdom of Golden Axe and kidnaps its royal family. After dispatching his minions, Adder is finally killed by the game's three heroes, but is resurrected for Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder. Here, he survives an initial attempt on
      his life but perishes due to the self-sacrifice of Gilius Thunderhead. Death Adder reappears many years later in Golden Axe: The Duel, where he is a playable character, and the penultimate boss. In 2010, IGN ranked Death Adder 83rd in "Top 100
      Videogames Villains".[citation needed]</li>
    <br>
    <li>In home console versions of Golden Axe, Death Adder is accompanied by his son, Death Adder Jr., and father, Death Bringer. These characters are palette swaps of the original Death Adder sprite, with similar powers and abilities. In the
      Genesis sequels, Golden Axe II and Golden Axe III, Death Adder's role is filled by Dark Guld and Damud Hellstrike, both of whom bear a strong resemblance to Death Adder.</li>
